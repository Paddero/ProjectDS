To Run the project:

Place the cracker.war file in the tomcat/webapps directory once it is running. 
Vigenere.jar file should be found in the web-inf library. 

To run the Vigenere.jar file use this command in the web-inf library directory:
java –cp ./vigenere.jar ie.gmit.sw.Servant "../warandpeace.txt"

My project somehow worked using eclipse, but when I went on to test it on localhost, things went messy and nothing worked. 

You can go to localhost:8080/cracker and type in your code and the key length.
