To Run the project:

Place the cracker.war file in the tomcat/webapps directory once it is running. 
Vigenere.jar file should be found in the web-inf library. 

To run the Vigenere.jar file use this command:
java –cp ./vigenere.jar ie.gmit.sw.Servant "../warandpeace.txt"

I don't know if I did something wrong but it was working while testing in eclipse. Once I got to testing on localhost things went wrong.

Go to localhost:8080/cracker and type in your code and the key length.
